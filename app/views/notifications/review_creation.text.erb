A new review has been made for <%= @session.title %> by <%= @review.presenter.name %>:

    We expect presenters to help each other to develop their proposals, based on peer to peer feedback. 
    You can give feedback on other people's proposals and improve your proposal based on the feedback you receive. 
    In this way, we will come to a set of quality session proposals in a transparent, community driven way.

Here's the review:

What I like:
<%= @review.things_i_like %>

Improvement opportunities:
<%= @review.things_to_improve %>

I give the session a '<%= @review.score %>' out of 10
    This number indicates the ratio of "things you like" to "things to improve". 
    If the session is almost perfect, this number will be close to 10, so this means that the things to improve are only minor improvements.
